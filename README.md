# open-legend-arrays
A collection of JSON/Object and PHP Arrays from the Open Legend RPG System

While working on additional tools for the open source **[Open Legend RPG](http://www.openlegendrpg.com/)**, I created a lot of reference arrays that weren't available as part of the [Core Rules](https://github.com/openlegend/core-rules). In the spirit of sharing, this is just a list of those arrays for anyone else to use.

Literally just copy/paste.
